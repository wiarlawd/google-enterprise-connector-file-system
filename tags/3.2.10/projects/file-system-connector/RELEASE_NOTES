Release 3.2.10, 13 March 2015
=============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality.

Open Issues
-----------
8737663 - Inheritance URLs in ACLs in Crawl-time Metadata are not
          normalized in GSA 7.0. If the Connector Manager host name is
          uppercase, then a mismatch in case breaks the ACL
          inheritance chain and access is denied to all documents.
          This issue is fixed in GSA 7.2.

          Workaround: Edit the feed.contenturl.prefix property in
          WEB-INF/applicationContext.properties to use a lowercase
          host name.

Issues Fixed Since 3.2.4
------------------------
6094457 - Files with MIME types listed under unsupportedMimeTypes were
          not fed. This change modifies the connector to conform to
          the behaviour used by the other connectors. If the MIME type
          is an unsupportedMimeType or the file exceeds the configured
          maxDocumentSize, the content will still be ignored, but the
          metadata is now indexed.

17281043 - In certain circumstances, a crawl request could block
           indefinitely in jCIFS when connecting to a share, and also
           block all subsequent crawl requests.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
This version of the file system connector requires Connector Manager 3.2.4,
or later. This version requires GSA 7.2, or 7.0.14.G.216 or later.

Manual upgrade instructions
---------------------------
Note that this release includes a new jcifs.jar, which in addition to the new
connector-filesystem.jar, should be copied to the Tomcat deployment directory:
webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/lib.


Release 3.2.4, 16 January 2014
==============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality.

Open Issues
-----------
8737663 - Inheritance URLs in ACLs in Crawl-time Metadata are not
          normalized in GSA 7.0. If the Connector Manager host name is
          uppercase, then a mismatch in case breaks the ACL
          inheritance chain and access is denied to all documents.
          This issue is fixed in GSA 7.2.

          Workaround: Edit the feed.contenturl.prefix property in
          WEB-INF/applicationContext.properties to use a lowercase
          host name.

Issues Fixed Since 3.2.2
------------------------
5222004 - Error message was unclear when start paths are not accepted
          by the include or exclude patterns.

9252758 - "Add another row" button label on the configuration form
          was encoded incorrectly.  This would cause the label to display
          incorrectly for some language translations.

11308734, 11307394 - Enforce message signing in jCIFS. This improves
          compatibility with Network Appliance storage systems.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
This version of the file system connector requires Connector Manager 3.2.4,
or later. This version requires GSA 7.2, or 7.0.14.G.216 or later.

Manual upgrade instructions
---------------------------
Note that this release includes a new jcifs.jar, which in addition to the new
connector-filesystem.jar, should be copied to the Tomcat deployment directory:

Release 3.2.2, 01 October 2013
==============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality.

Open Issues
-----------
8737663 - Inheritance URLs in ACLs in Crawl-time Metadata are not
          normalized in GSA 7.0. If the Connector Manager host name is
          uppercase, then a mismatch in case breaks the ACL
          inheritance chain and access is denied to all documents.
          This issue is fixed in GSA 7.2.

          Workaround: Edit the feed.contenturl.prefix property in
          WEB-INF/applicationContext.properties to use a lowercase
          host name.

Issues Fixed Since 3.2.0
------------------------
Issue 6444005: "All pipe instances are busy" error intermittently strips the ACL
               from a document when the document is fed.  By stripping the ACL,
               authorization for the document falls back to connector 
               authorization. An authentication mechanism that captures
               credentials, such as HTTP or LDAP, is required for Connector
               authorization. The file system connector does not support
               authentication.

               This release adds an advanced configuration option,
               "useAuthzOnAclError". If this option is "true", then no ACL will
               be provided, forcing connector authorization to be used. If the
               option is "false", then a RepositoryDocumentException will be
               thrown, forcing the document to be skipped. The default value
               for the useAuthzOnAclError property is "false".

               See also the fix to Issue 10783874 below.

Issue 9364617: If last modified date was older than creation date filesystem
               connector would feed creation date as the last modified date.
               This would occur if files were copied or moved accross Microsoft
               Windows filesystems.

Issue 9654305: Traversal stops if file name contains line terminator characters.
               Users may include newlines and other line separator characters
               in their file names. This caused the pattern matcher for the 
               include and exclude patterns to throw NullPointerException.

               Filenames that contained these line terminators would fail:
                 - carriage-return character ('\r')
                 - newline (line feed) character ('\n')
                 - next-line character ('\u0085')
                 - line-separator character ('\u2028')
                 - paragraph-separator character ('\u2029)

               If customers actually want to include these characters in their
               include or exclude patterns, they will need to specify the URL
               escaped, UTF-8 encodings of the characters in the patterns:
                 - carriage-return character ('\r')     %0D
                 - newline (line feed) character ('\n') %0A
                 - next-line character ('\u0085')       %C2%85
                 - line-separator character ('\u2028')  %E2%80%A8
                 - paragraph-separator ('\u2029)        %E2%80%A9

               Google recommends you use regexpIgnoreCase to catch upper- and
               lower-case representations of the hex encodings.

Issue 10149530: Connector cannot retrieve ACLs from EMC Isilon storage system.

Issue 10783874: Improve error handling for "All pipe instances are busy" errors.
                The connector now interprets these as intermittent availability
                issues with the file server, typically due to excess load.
                The connector will stop traversals for a short period, then
                reattempt access to the failed files.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
This version of the file system connector requires Connector Manager 3.2.0.
This version of the connector requires Java 6 JRE or newer.
The use of a Java 5 runtime is no longer supported.
This version requires GSA 7.2, or 7.0.14.G.216 or later.

Manual upgrade instructions
---------------------------
Note that this release includes a new jcifs.jar, which in addition to the new
connector-filesystem.jar, should be copied to the Tomcat deployment directory:
webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/lib.


Release 3.2.0, 12 July 2013
===========================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality.

Open Issues
-----------
8737663 - Inheritance URLs in ACLs in Crawl-time Metadata are not
          normalized in GSA 7.0. If the Connector Manager host name is
          uppercase, then a mismatch in case breaks the ACL
          inheritance chain and access is denied to all documents.
          This issue is fixed in GSA 7.2.

          Workaround: Edit the feed.contenturl.prefix property in
          WEB-INF/applicationContext.properties to use a lowercase
          host name.

Issues Fixed Since 3.0.8
------------------------
Issue 8161087: The Connector now supplies file metadata at crawl-time,
               rather than feed-time, for GSA versions 7.2 and newer.
               This avoids issue 6781122, wherein the internal metadata
               extracted from documents is overwritten by the external
               metadata when the document is sent again in a feed.

Issue 9415184: Connector blocked on I/O when calling MimeTypeDetector.
               MimeTypeDetector would inadvertently attempt to open
               some of the supplied files when it was attempting to
               determine the MIME type by filename extension only.
               Since the supplied names were rarely local files,
               the MimeTypeDetector would quickly become backlogged
               on blocked file I/O. The use of the underlying third
               party MimeUtil library was altered to ensure that no
               attempt would be made to open the named file.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
This version of the file system connector requires Connector Manager 3.2.0.
This version of the connector requires Java 6 JRE or newer.
The use of a Java 5 runtime is no longer supported.
This version requires GSA 7.2, or 7.0.14.G.216 or later.


Release 3.0.8, 08 May 2013
==========================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
Issue 7684717: Files incorrectly inherit list folder contents permission.
               List folder permissions grants read access to a folder and
               its sub-folders, but it should not grant read access to the
               files contained within those folders.

Issue 8511258: In a newly configured File system connector with Disable
               Traversal option selected, the Disable Traversal option
               was not respected.

Issue 8592252: The connector supplies a google:contentlength property,
               which specifies the length of the document content, in bytes.
               This allows the Connector Manager's GetDocumentContent
               servlet to supply the  Content-Length HTTP header in the
               servlet response.  This works around a problem where
               crawled files were truncated at 32 megabytes by the GSA.


Release 3.0.6, 04 March 2013
============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality. Users of version 3.0.0, 3.0.2, or 3.0.4 are strongly
encouraged to upgrade.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
Issue 7355081: File System Connector did not support hidden file shares.
               SMB "Administrative Shares" (those whose name end in '$') are
               marked "hidden".  Even though the connector explicitly
               excludes hidden files and files under hidden directories, the
               connector now allows the user to specify a hidden start path.

Issue 7418773: If a connection to the file server was lost, the JCIFS session
               and transport layers were left in an inconsistent state. This
               would result in nearly all subsequent requests throwing either
               NT_STATUS_NOT_FOUND or "The parameter is incorrect" exceptions,
               which would halt traversal. This release includes a new 
               jcifs.jar which has been patched to retry broken connections.

Issue 7577675: Localization strings were improperly escaped in JavaScript for
               the connector configuration form.

Issue 7690736: Inherit-only ACEs should appear in an ACL associated with the
               parent directory, not the child.  We were folding Inherit-only
               ACEs from the parent onto the child.  Consequently, if the
               parent ACE changed, that change would not be reflected in the
               child's copy.

Issue 7690993 (Code Site Issue 41): CopySmbToLocalDisk leaked Input/Output
               Streams if exceptions are thrown when copying files.  This
               could cause the process to run out of memory.

Manual upgrade instructions
---------------------------
Note that this release includes a new jcifs.jar, which in addition to the new
connector-filesystem.jar, should be copied to the Tomcat deployment directory:
webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/lib.


Release 3.0.4, 19 November 2012
===============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality. Users of version 3.0.0 or 3.0.2 are strongly encouraged
to upgrade.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
               Improve an error message in the admin console when the
               traversal user has no access rights on the file share.

Issue 7369489: Remove an unused AceSecurityLevel check from SmbAclBuilder.
               Update AceSecurityLevel comment in advanced config to make
               clear that the property is not used when inherited ACLs are
               enabled with GSA 7.0.

Issue 7383538: SmbAclBuilder.isReadAce() should include Generic access rights.
               The connector now recognizes ACE.GENERIC_ALL and ACE.GENERIC_READ
               as valid read access rights.

Issue 7386939: Feed namespaces and case-insensitive ACLs to GSA 7.x, even if
               inherited ACLs are not being used.

Issue 7430175: Lister and retriever threads cause a deadlock. Fixed a deadlock
               problem in JCIFS when used with DFS.
               
Manual upgrade instructions
---------------------------
Note that this release includes a new jcifs.jar, which in addition to the new
connector-filesystem.jar, should be copied to the Tomcat deployment directory:
webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/lib.


Release 3.0.2, 17 October 2012
==============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality. Users of version 3.0.0 are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
Issue 7166051: Deny HTTP HEAD requests from legacy authorization, which would
               always permit access to secure documents.
Issue 7291282: Connector did not feed the Windows "NT AUTHORITY" groups
               "Authenticated Users" and "Interactive".
Issue 7291526: Connector feeds "inherit-from parent" ACLs, even if file does
               not inherit ACLs from its parent.
Issue 7307947: Connector may skip some explicit ACEs when inherited ACEs
               are present.
Issue 7309510: Connector root directory ACL includes inherit-only ACEs.
Issue 7343330: NullPointerException thrown when closing SmbFileInputStream.


Release 3.0.0, 03 October 2012
==============================

Introduction
------------
The file system connector version 3.0.0 is a significant re-engineering of the
connector implementation. 

The most notable improvements are:
  - The connector moves from a Diffing Connector model to a Lister/Retriever
    model. This is a major architectural change for the connector.
  - Vastly improved feed and indexing performance.
  - Support for ACL inheritance and deny for SMB file systems.
  - The connector is now aware of the Traversal Schedule.
  - Upgraded third party components to JCIFS v1.3.17 and MimeUtil v2.1.2.

File system connector version 3.0.0 requires Connector Manager version 3.0.0.
For information about manually upgrading an earlier file system connector
installation to version 3.0.0, please see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-file-system/wiki/UpgradeToVersion3

Lister/Retriever Conversion
---------------------------
The file system connector version 3.0.0 uses a Lister/Retriever model to feed
documents to the Google Search Appliance.  Rather than pushing a Content feed
to the GSA, the Lister pushes a Metadata-and-URL feed, where the URL (referred
to as the ContentURL) points back to the connector's document content Retriever.
The document content is then fetched by the GSA using the ContentURL.  Since the
document content is no longer contained within the feed itself, the feeds are
much smaller.

Another benefit to the Lister/Retriever model is the responsibility for 
document change detection moves from the connector to the search appliance,
which uses HTTP "If-Modified-Since" request header to conditionally retrieve
changed content.  This change simplifies the connector implementation
considerably, removing its dependence on the "Diffing Connector" infrastructure.

As a result of the move away from the Diffing Connector infrastructure,
the "queueSize" Advanced Configuration option has been deprecated, and
will be ignored if set.

Google recommends that you use GSA version 6.14 Patch 2 or later, for improved
"If-Modified-Since" handling and Flexible Authorization support.

For improved document security, use HTTPS communications between the 
GSA and the Tomcat web application server hosting the connector. See:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/wiki/SettingUpHTTPS

ACL Namespaces, ACL Inheritance, and Deny ACLs
----------------------------------------------
The file system connector version 3.0.0 supports Access Control Lists (ACLs)
that may be inherited from a parent folder or file share.  This reduces the
number of files/directories that must be re-indexed as a result of an ACL 
change to a folder far up the directory hierarchy.

This version of the file system connector also supports Deny ACLs - ACLs which
deny access to specific individuals or groups.

The file system connector also supports local and global namespaces
for ACL users and groups.

Note GSA version 7.0 or newer is required to support ACL namespaces, 
inheritance, and Deny ACLs.  The file system connector only supports ACLs
for SMB file systems at this time.

Default User and Group ACL Formats Have Changed
-----------------------------------------------
The default ACL format changed between file system connector version 2.x and 
version 3.0.0.  The new default user ACL format is "domain\user".  The new 
default group ACL format is "domain\group".  These new defaults will be the
most appropriate formats to use with GSA version 7.0 and later.  The previous
ACL formats, "user" and "group" (without the domain), are unlikely to work with
GSA version 7.0.  If the Authentication mechanism for this connector returns a
domain element, then the user and group ACLs must also include the domain.

If you have previously explicitly configured the user and group ACL formats
in the Advanced Configuration, that explicit configuration will still be
honored (although you may wish to change it if upgrading the GSA as well).
If you have not explicitly configured the user and group ACL formats, the
new default format will be used.

If, when using file system connector version 3.0.0, you wish to use the
unadorned "user" and "group" formats, you must explicitly enable those
formats in the Advanced Configuration.

Traversal Schedule Aware
------------------------
The file system connector version 3.0.0 is aware of the Traversal Schedule,
including scheduled traversal intervals, Retry Delay, and run-once traversals
(Retry Delay of -1).  Previous versions of the connector ignored the Traversal
Schedule, continually scanning the repository outside of the traversal 
intervals.  Older versions of the connector also ignored the Retry Delay, 
replicating its functionality with advanced configuration options.

Since the connector is now aware of the Traversal Schedule, the
"delayBetweenTwoScansInMillis" and "introduceDelayAfterEveryScan" advanced 
configuration options are now deprecated and will be ignored if set.

The Retry Delay governs the delay between traversals of the repository.
Most traversals are incremental traversals and look only for items that have
changed since the last traversal, based upon the file's last-modified timestamp.
Some traversals are full traversals (see below), which feed all appropriate
contents of the repository to the Search Appliance.

The Full Traversal Interval governs the interval between full, rather than
incremental, traversals of the repository.  You may wish to configure the
forced Full Traversal Interval for the needs of your organization.  File
and directory adds and copies and changes to file contents are detected
during the connector's incremental traversals.  However, moved or renamed
files and changes to ACLs and other metadata may only be detected during full
traversals.  Frequent full traversals may overwhelm the Search Appliance,
bogging down its feed processing.  Long full traversal intervals increase the
time it takes for the Search Appliance to notice certain types of changes.

A full traversal may also be triggered manually at any time by resetting 
the connector in the Search Appliance Admin Console.  A full traversal is
automatically triggered if you change the connector's configuration or
schedule, or restart the Tomcat web application server.

If you have a large number of files in your repository (more than 1 million),
the default Retry Delay and Full Traversal Interval values are likely too 
small.  Consider Retry Delay values of hours (4 hours = 240 minutes).
Consider a Full Traversal Interval that is at least 2 days for each million
documents fed.

At this time, the connector ignores the Traversal Rate configuration.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
Issues 5409517,5453293: File system connector should feed in Deny ACL.
Issue 5833106: File system connector running slowly against DFS.
Issue 6299009: File system connector has multiple issues in crawling when the
               file name has Unicode characters.
Issue 6311078: Onboard file system connector accepts / as Start path and fails

               configurable. ACLs are now case-insensitive by default, and
               can be configured to be case-sensitive by adding a document
               filter bean definition to the file system connector Advanced
               Configuration XML on the connector configuration form:
               <bean class="com.google.enterprise.connector.util.filter.AclPropertyFilter">
                 <property name="caseSensitivityType" value="everything-case-sensitive"/>
               </bean>

Issue 7089492: Full traversal interval has no value when upgrading
               connector from version 2.x to version 3.0.
Issue 7069623: Connector feeds well-known security groups in local namespace.
               This affected the Windows groups "Administrators", "Users",
               "Guests", and "Everyone".


Release 2.8.6, May 4, 2012
==========================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality. Users of previous releases are encouraged to review
the changes below to determine whether to upgrade.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
Issue 6109697: File system connector throws a NullPointerException and
               halts traversal. The exception may be logged to stdout
               or in catalina.out. This issue was introduced in
               version 2.8.4 and can occur when the traversal user
               does not have permission to read the files in a
               directory.
Issue 5589982: File-system connector fails to crawl Samba share,
               SmbException: 0xC000011F is observed. The problem could
               potentially occur on other SMB implementations, but has
               only been reported on Samba shares.
Issue 5546078: Restart of FileSystem Connector when share is down causes
               exception which halts the traversal. No new content would
               be crawled.

Known limitations:
-----------------
Issue 5237436: File system connector doesn't allow including patterns for selective folders under a file share.
Issue 5111509: File system connector goes into infinite loop when connector is reset. This is reproducible only for
               very small file shares.

Release 2.8.4, February 21, 2012
================================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality. Users of previous releases are encouraged to
upgrade.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
Issue 5398852: File System connector should not modify last access
               time on folders when lastAccessResetFlagForSmb is enabled.
Issues 5734921, 5735103: Do not store access times when
               lastAccessResetFlagForSmb feature is off. This avoids
               a memory leak and performance degradation.
Issue 5806403: Connector sends delete feeds when the share is only
               temporarily available.
Issue 5028655, 6019938: Fix logic bug where recovery-files' age comparison
               was broken.  This could lead to the connector resending the
               same files again after Tomcat was restarted.

Known limitations:
-----------------
Issue 5269133: File system connector is not able to feed pptx file format.
Issue 5237436: File system connector doesn't allow including patterns for selective folders under a file share.
