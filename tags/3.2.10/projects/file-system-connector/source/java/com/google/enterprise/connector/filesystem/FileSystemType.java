/**
 * This represents a type of file system: SMB, NFS, etc. It provides a way to
 * translate a String path into a ReadonlyFile corresponding to the path.
 * <p/>
 * When adding support for a new file system type (for example AFP),
 * the developer would typically provide implementations of three interfaces.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link FileSystemType} (usually by extending
 * {@link AbstractFileSystemType}) This provides a factory for converting
 * file system specific pathnames into {@link ReadonlyFile} instances.</li>
 * <li>{@link ReadonlyFile} (usually by extending {@link AbstractReadonlyFile})
 * This provides the implementation of higher-level file access used by this
 * connector.  File system specific error handling is typically done here.</li>
 * <li>{@link FileDelegate} This codifies a partial java.io.File Interface
 * over the native file objects (like SmbFile, XFile, etc). This implementation
 * is only required if the {@code ReadonlyFile} implementation extends
 * {@code AbstractReadonlyFile}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * In order for the new file system support to be recognized by the connector,
 * the {@code FileSystemType} implementation must be registered with the
 * {@link FileSystemTypeRegistry}.  This is typically done in the connector's
 * Spring bean configuration in {@code connectorInstance.xml} and/or
 * {@code connectorDefaults.xml}.
