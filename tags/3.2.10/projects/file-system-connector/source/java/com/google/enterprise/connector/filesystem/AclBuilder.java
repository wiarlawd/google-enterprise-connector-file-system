   * In addition Windows defines a large number of <a
   * href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/243330">built in users and
   * groups</a>. Some of these have per machine scope and some have per domain
   * scope. Generally, this filters these so the returned {@link List} may be
   * missing entries for some users or groups even though windows would
   * actually grant read access. Currently the following built in groups
   * are included in the returned ACL.
   * <OL>
   * <LI>Administrators
   * <LI>Everyone
   * <LI>Guests
   * <LI>Users
   * </OL>
   * Note that the included names for these special groups do not include a
   * domain or machine name. JCIFS does not provide one. It is important the
   * GSA administrator understand that when Windows performs an access check
   * for a file the membership of these built in groups is evaluated on the
   * machine hosting the file. In some environments different machines
   * may not agree on group membership for these built in groups.
   * GSA will evaluate the group membership on the appliance itself based on
   * its configuration. Thus to assure proper security checking the
   * administrator must configure GSA to appropriately evaluate the membership
   * of these groups.
   * The algorithm to calculate final set of ACL depends on security level set
   * by the configurable parameter 'aceSecurityLevel' There are 4 possible
   * values for this parameter

   * The most restrictive security setting is 'FILEANDSHARE' that is
   * intersection of file and share level ACL.
   * The least restrictive security setting is 'FILEORSHARE' that is union
   * of file and share level ACL because this will give access to user as long
   * as the user has either file level or share level access.
   * So getting the access is most probable in this scenario.
   * The default security setting is the most restrictive i.e. 'FILEANDSHARE'
