    Security level to be considered for fetching ACL for a file
    There are 4 possible values for this parameter. These are in the order of
    Stronger to weaker security levels.
    FILEANDSHARE
    SHARE
    FILE
    FILEORSHARE
    Default value is 'FILEANDSHARE'  since it is the most restrictive of all
    4 scenarios.

    Note: For GSA 7.0 and above, this configuration is ignored and FILEANDSHARE
    is always used, unless inherited ACLs are disabled in the Connector Manager
    advanced configuration.

    style file path. E.g. "c://share/data"

    Represents the format in which ACE entries should be fed to GSA for groups
    Possible values are:
      domain\group
      group@domain
      group   (only group name without domain information)

    Note: For GSA 7.0 and above, user and group names without the domain is
    rarely the correct choice.  Use it only if your authentication mechanism
    also does not supply a domain.

    The default value is "domain\group".

    Cushion for inaccurate timestamps in if-modified-since comparisons,
    usually due to unsynchronized clocks.

    The cushion value is the number of minutes before the if-modified-since
    check time in which a file may still be considered  modified.
    For instance, if the cushion is 60 minutes, and we are looking for files
    modified since time X, a file modified at X - 30 minutes whould still
    qualify.

    The default value is 60 minutes (1 hour).

    Number of threads in the traversal thread pool. Each startpoint
