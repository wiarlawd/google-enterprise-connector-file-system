Welcome to the Google Enterprise Connector for File Systems

Steps to build Google Enterprise Connector for File Systems
===========================================================

1. Ensure that you have Apache Ant 1.8, Subversion 1.6, Tomcat 7 and JDK 1.6
   installed on your system.  For details, see the "Prerequisites" section here:
   http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/wiki/DeveloperEnvironmentSetup

2. Ensure that you have Connector Manager on your system. You can get it at
   http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/source/checkout
   It is recommended you check out a stable branch or tag of the Connector Manager,
   instead of the trunk.  Choose a compatible Connector Manager version
   as described in the version.properties file in this directory.

   2a) svn checkout https://google-enterprise-connector-manager.googlecode.com/svn/branches/3.0.x/ google-enterprise-connector-manager
   2b) Follow the instructions for building the Connector Manager as described here:
       http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/wiki/DeveloperEnvironmentSetup
   2c) Execute ANT target "ant install-all" to build the Connector Manager jar
       files.  If you get compile errors "package javax.jcr does not exist",
       go back to the previous step and make sure JCR was installed correctly.
   2d) While still in the Connector Manager "projects" directory, create a
       google-enterprise-connector-filesystem.properties file in your home directory.  
   
       For Unix enter
         echo "connector.manager.home=$PWD" > ~/google-enterprise-connector-filesystem.properties 

       For Windows
         echo connector.manager.home=%CD% > "%HOMEPATH%\google-enterprise-connector-filesystem.properties"

3. Change directory to projects/file-system-connector which contains this README
   file. Execute "ant jar_prod" to build the file system connector jar file
   build/prod/jar/connector-filesystem.jar.

4. To verify your set up run "ant run_tests". You should see 'BUILD SUCCESSFUL'
   at the end, which means your setup is correct.

5. Execute ANT target "ant download_filesystem_connector" to create deliverables
   (source-code and binary) under "downloads".
